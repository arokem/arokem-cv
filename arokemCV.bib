			 JOSS article contains an abstract describing the purpose and
			 functionality of the software, references, and a link to the

			 submission, which encompasses the full set of software
			 artifacts. Submission and review proceed in the open, on GitHub.

			 Unlike other journals, JOSS does not reject articles requiring
			 major revision; while not yet accepted, articles remain visible
			 and under review until the authors make adequate changes (or
			 withdraw, if unable to meet requirements). Once an article is
			 accepted, JOSS gives it a digital object identifier (DOI),

			 Kraft, Nathan J B and Lambers, Janneke Hille Ris",
abstract  = "Neighborhood models have allowed us to test many hypotheses
			 regarding the drivers of variation in tree growth, but require
			 considerable computation due to the many empirically supported
			 non-linear relationships they include. Regularized regression
			 represents a far more efficient neighborhood modeling method,
			 but it is unclear whether such an ecologically unrealistic model
			 can provide accurate insights on tree growth. Rapid computation
			 is becoming increasingly important as ecological datasets grow
			 in size, and may be essential when using neighborhood models to
			 predict tree growth beyond sample plots or into the future. We
			 built a novel regularized regression model of tree growth and
			 investigated whether it reached the same conclusions as a
			 commonly used neighborhood model, regarding hypotheses of how
			 tree growth is influenced by the species identity of neighboring
			 trees. We also evaluated the ability of both models to
			 interpolate the growth of trees not included in the model
			 fitting dataset. Our regularized regression model replicated
			 most of the classical model's inferences in a fraction of the
			 time without using high-performance computing resources. We
			 found that both methods could interpolate out-of-sample tree
			 growth, but the method making the most accurate predictions
			 varied among focal species. Regularized regression is
			 particularly efficient for comparing hypotheses because it
			 automates the process of model selection and can handle
			 correlated explanatory variables. This feature means that
			 regularized regression could also be used to select among
			 potential explanatory variables (e.g., climate variables) and
			 thereby streamline the development of a classical neighborhood
			 model. Both regularized regression and classical methods can
			 interpolate out-of-sample tree growth, but future research must
			 determine whether predictions can be extrapolated to trees
			 experiencing novel conditions. Overall, we conclude that
			 regularized regression methods can complement classical methods
			 in the investigation of tree growth drivers and represent a
			 valuable tool for advancing this field toward prediction.",

              maturational changes in the latency of visual signals.
              Thirty-eight children participated in a cross-sectional study
              including diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and
              magnetoencephalography (MEG) sessions. During the MEG
              acquisition, participants performed a lexical decision and a
              fixation task on words presented at varying levels of contrast
              and noise. For all stimuli and tasks, early evoked fields were
              observed around 100 ms after stimulus onset (M100), with slower
              and lower amplitude responses for low as compared to high
              contrast stimuli. The optic radiations and optic tracts were
              identified in each individual's brain based on diffusion MRI
              tractography. The diffusion properties of the optic radiations
              predicted M100 responses, especially for high contrast stimuli.
              Higher optic radiation fractional anisotropy (FA) values were
              associated with faster and larger M100 responses. Over this
              developmental window, the M100 responses to high contrast stimuli
              became faster with age and the optic radiation FA mediated this
              effect. These findings suggest that the maturation of the optic

    abstract = "{As the global health crisis unfolded, many academic conferences moved online in 2020. This move has been hailed as a positive step towards inclusivity in its attenuation of economic, physical, and legal barriers and effectively enabled many individuals from groups that have traditionally been underrepresented to join and participate. A number of studies have outlined how moving online made it possible to gather a more global community and has increased opportunities for individuals with various constraints, e.g., caregiving responsibilities.Yet, the mere existence of online conferences is no guarantee that everyone can attend and participate meaningfully. In fact, many elements of an online conference are still significant barriers to truly diverse participation: the tools used can be inaccessible for some individuals; the scheduling choices can favour some geographical locations; the set-up of the conference can provide more visibility to well-established researchers and reduce opportunities for early-career researchers. While acknowledging the benefits of an online setting, especially for individuals who have traditionally been underrepresented or excluded, we recognize that fostering social justice requires inclusivity to actively be centered in every aspect of online conference design.Here, we draw from the literature and from our own experiences to identify practices that purposefully encourage a diverse community to attend, participate in, and lead online conferences. Reflecting on how to design more inclusive online events is especially important as multiple scientific organizations have announced that they will continue offering an online version of their event when in-person conferences can resume.}",

  abstract = "The analysis of brain-imaging data requires complex processing
              pipelines to support findings on brain function or pathologies.
              Recent work has shown that variability in analytical decisions,
              small amounts of noise, or computational environments can lead to
              substantial differences in the results, endangering the trust in
              conclusions. We explored the instability of results by
              instrumenting a structural connectome estimation pipeline with
              Monte Carlo Arithmetic to introduce random noise throughout. We
              evaluated the reliability of the connectomes, the robustness of
              their features, and the eventual impact on analysis. The
              stability of results was found to range from perfectly stable
              (i.e. all digits of data significant) to highly unstable (i.e. 0
              - 1 significant digits). This paper highlights the potential of
              leveraging induced variance in estimates of brain connectivity to
              reduce the bias in networks without compromising reliability,
              alongside increasing the robustness and potential upper-bound of
              their applications in the classification of individual
              differences. We demonstrate that stability evaluations are
              necessary for understanding error inherent to brain imaging
              experiments, and how numerical analysis can be applied to typical
              analytical workflows both in brain imaging and other domains of
              computational sciences, as the techniques used were data and
              context agnostic and globally relevant. Overall, while the
              extreme variability in results due to analytical instabilities
              could severely hamper our understanding of brain organization, it
              also affords us the opportunity to increase the robustness of
              findings.",

Meanwhile, automated approaches lack the accuracy of expert examination. We propose to 1) start with expertly labelled data, 2) amplify labels through web applications that engage citizen scientists, and 3) train machine learning on amplified labels, to emulate the experts. Demonstrating this, we developed a system to quality control brain magnetic resonance images. Expert-labeled data were amplified by citizen scientists through a simple web interface. A deep learning algorithm was then trained to predict data quality, based on citizen scientist labels. Deep learning performed as well as specialized algorithms for quality control (AUC=0.99). Combining citizen science and deep learning can generalize and scale expert decision making; this is particularly important in disciplines where specialized, automated tools do not yet exist.},

	Abstract = {Degenerative retinal diseases such as retinitis pigmentosa and macular degeneration cause irreversible vision loss in more than 10 million people worldwide. Retinal prostheses, now implanted in over 250 patients worldwide, electrically stimulate surviving cells in order to evoke neuronal responses that are interpreted by the brain as visual percepts (`phosphenes'). However, instead of seeing focal spots of light, current implant users perceive highly distorted phosphenes that vary in shape both across subjects and electrodes. We characterized these distortions by asking users of the Argus retinal prosthesis system (Second Sight Medical Products Inc.) to draw electrically elicited percepts on a touchscreen. Using ophthalmic fundus imaging and computational modeling, we show that elicited percepts can be accurately predicted by the topographic organization of optic nerve fiber bundles in each subject's retina, successfully replicating visual percepts ranging from `blobs'to oriented `streaks'and `wedges'depending on the retinal location of the stimulating electrode. This provides the first evidence that activation of passing axon fibers accounts for the rich repertoire of phosphene shape commonly reported in psychophysical experiments, which can severely distort the quality of the generated visual experience. Overall our findings argue for more detailed modeling of biological detail across neural engineering applications.},

	Abstract = {Diffusion MRI (dMRI) holds great promise for illuminating the biological changes that underpin cognitive development. The diffusion of water molecules probes the cellular structure of brain tissue, and biophysical modeling of the diffusion signal can be used to make inferences about specific tissue properties that vary over development or predict cognitive performance. However, applying these models to study development requires that the parameters can be reliably estimated given the constraints of data collection with children. Here we collect repeated scans using a typical multi-shell diffusion MRI protocol in a group of children (ages 7--12) and use two popular modeling techniques to examine individual differences in white matter structure. We first assess scan-rescan reliability of model parameters and show that axon water faction can be reliably estimated from a relatively fast acquisition, without applying spatial smoothing or de-noising. We then investigate developmental changes in the white matter, and individual differences that correlate with reading skill. Specifically, we test the hypothesis that previously reported correlations between reading skill and diffusion anisotropy in the corpus callosum reflect increased axon water fraction in poor readers. Both models support this interpretation, highlighting the utility of these approaches for testing specific hypotheses about cognitive development.},

	Abstract = {White matter tissue properties are known to correlate with
              performance across domains ranging from reading to math, to
              executive function. Here, we use a longitudinal intervention
              design to examine experience-dependent growth in reading skills
              and white matter in grade school-aged, struggling readers.
              Diffusion MRI data were collected at regular intervals during an
              8-week, intensive reading intervention. These measurements reveal
              large-scale changes throughout a collection of white matter
              tracts, in concert with growth in reading skill. Additionally, we
              identify tracts whose properties predict reading skill but remain
              fixed throughout the intervention, suggesting that some
              anatomical properties stably predict the ease with which a child
              learns to read, while others dynamically reflect the effects of
              experience. These results underscore the importance of
              considering recent experience when interpreting cross-sectional
              anatomy-behavior correlations. Widespread changes throughout the
              white matter may be a hallmark of rapid plasticity associated
              with an intensive learning experience.},

	Abstract = {Despite advances in artificial intelligence (AI), its application in medical imaging has been burdened and limited by expert-generated labels. We used images from optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA), a relatively new imaging modality that measures retinal blood flow, to train an AI algorithm to generate flow maps from standard optical coherence tomography (OCT) images, exceeding the ability and bypassing the need for expert labeling. Deep learning was able to infer flow from single structural OCT images with similar fidelity to OCTA and significantly better than expert clinicians (P < 0.00001). Our model allows generating flow maps from large volumes of previously collected OCT data in existing clinical trials and clinical practice. This finding demonstrates a novel application of AI to medical imaging, whereby subtle regularities between different modalities are used to image the same body part and AI is used to generate detailed inferences of tissue function from structure imaging.},

@article{Huppenkothen2018,
	Abstract = {As scientific disciplines grapple with more datasets of rapidly increasing complexity and size, new approaches are urgently required to introduce new statistical and computational tools into research communities and improve the cross-disciplinary exchange of ideas. In this paper, we introduce a type of scientific workshop, called a hack week, which allows for fast dissemination of new methodologies into scientific communities and fosters exchange and collaboration within and between disciplines. We present implementations of this concept in astronomy, neuroscience, and geoscience and show that hack weeks produce positive learning outcomes, foster lasting collaborations, yield scientific results, and promote positive attitudes toward open science.Across many scientific disciplines, methods for recording, storing, and analyzing data are rapidly increasing in complexity. Skillfully using data science tools that manage this complexity requires training in new programming languages and frameworks as well as immersion in new modes of interaction that foster data sharing, collaborative software development, and exchange across disciplines. Learning these skills from traditional university curricula can be challenging because most courses are not designed to evolve on time scales that can keep pace with rapidly shifting data science methods. Here, we present the concept of a hack week as an effective model offering opportunities for networking and community building, education in state-of-the-art data science methods, and immersion in collaborative project work. We find that hack weeks are successful at cultivating collaboration and facilitating the exchange of knowledge. Participants self-report that these events help them in both their day-to-day research as well as their careers. Based on our results, we conclude that hack weeks present an effective, easy-to-implement, fairly low-cost tool to positively impact data analysis literacy in academic disciplines, foster collaboration, and cultivate best practices.},

	Abstract = {Human neuroscience research faces several challenges with regards
              to reproducibility. While scientists are generally aware that
              data sharing is important, it is not always clear how to share
              data in a manner that allows other labs to understand and
              reproduce published findings. Here we report a new open source
              tool, AFQ-Browser, that builds an interactive website as a
              companion to a diffusion MRI study. Because AFQ-Browser is
              portable---it runs in any web-browser---it can facilitate
              transparency and data sharing. Moreover, by leveraging new
              web-visualization technologies to create linked views between
              different dimensions of the dataset (anatomy, diffusion metrics,
              subject metadata), AFQ-Browser facilitates exploratory data
              analysis, fueling new discoveries based on previously published
              datasets. In an era where Big Data is playing an increasingly
              prominent role in scientific discovery, so will browser-based
              tools for exploring high-dimensional datasets, communicating

    abstract = "{Ridge regression is a regularization technique that penalizes the L2-norm of the coefficients in linear regression. One of the challenges of using ridge regression is the need to set a hyperparameter (α) that controls the amount of regularization. Cross-validation is typically used to select the best α from a set of candidates. However, efficient and appropriate selection of α can be challenging. This becomes prohibitive when large amounts of data are analyzed. Because the selected α depends on the scale of the data and correlations across predictors, it is also not straightforwardly interpretable.The present work addresses these challenges through a novel approach to ridge regression. We propose to reparameterize ridge regression in terms of the ratio γ between the L2-norms of the regularized and unregularized coefficients. We provide an algorithm that efficiently implements this approach, called fractional ridge regression, as well as open-source software implementations in Python and matlab (https://github.com/nrdg/fracridge). We show that the proposed method is fast and scalable for large-scale data problems. In brain imaging data, we demonstrate that this approach delivers results that are straightforward to interpret and compare across models and datasets.Fractional ridge regression has several benefits: the solutions obtained for different γ are guaranteed to vary, guarding against wasted calculations; and automatically span the relevant range of regularization, avoiding the need for arduous manual exploration. These properties make fractional ridge regression particularly suitable for analysis of large complex datasets.}",
