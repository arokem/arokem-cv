abstract = "Diffusion MRI (dMRI) holds great promise for illuminating the biological changes that underpin cognitive development. The diffusion of water molecules probes the cellular structure of brain tissue, and biophysical modeling of the diffusion signal can be used to make inferences about specific tissue properties that vary over development or predict cognitive performance. However, applying these models to study development requires that the parameters can be reliably estimated given the constraints of data collection with children. Here we collect repeated scans using a typical multi-shell diffusion MRI protocol in a group of children (ages 7â€“12) and use two popular modeling techniques to examine individual differences in white matter structure. We first assess scan-rescan reliability of model parameters and show that axon water faction can be reliably estimated from a relatively fast acquisition, without applying spatial smoothing or de-noising. We then investigate developmental changes in the white matter, and individual differences that correlate with reading skill. Specifically, we test the hypothesis that previously reported correlations between reading skill and diffusion anisotropy in the corpus callosum reflect increased axon water fraction in poor readers. Both models support this interpretation, highlighting the utility of these approaches for testing specific hypotheses about cognitive development."

              design to examine experience-dependent growth in reading skills
              and white matter in grade school-aged, struggling readers.
              Diffusion MRI data were collected at regular intervals during an
              8-week, intensive reading intervention. These measurements reveal
              large-scale changes throughout a collection of white matter
              tracts, in concert with growth in reading skill. Additionally, we
              identify tracts whose properties predict reading skill but remain
              fixed throughout the intervention, suggesting that some
              anatomical properties stably predict the ease with which a child
              learns to read, while others dynamically reflect the effects of
              experience. These results underscore the importance of
              considering recent experience when interpreting cross-sectional
              anatomy-behavior correlations. Widespread changes throughout the

	abstract = {As scientific disciplines grapple with more datasets of rapidly increasing complexity and size, new approaches are urgently required to introduce new statistical and computational tools into research communities and improve the cross-disciplinary exchange of ideas. In this paper, we introduce a type of scientific workshop, called a hack week, which allows for fast dissemination of new methodologies into scientific communities and fosters exchange and collaboration within and between disciplines. We present implementations of this concept in astronomy, neuroscience, and geoscience and show that hack weeks produce positive learning outcomes, foster lasting collaborations, yield scientific results, and promote positive attitudes toward open science.Across many scientific disciplines, methods for recording, storing, and analyzing data are rapidly increasing in complexity. Skillfully using data science tools that manage this complexity requires training in new programming languages and frameworks as well as immersion in new modes of interaction that foster data sharing, collaborative software development, and exchange across disciplines. Learning these skills from traditional university curricula can be challenging because most courses are not designed to evolve on time scales that can keep pace with rapidly shifting data science methods. Here, we present the concept of a hack week as an effective model offering opportunities for networking and community building, education in state-of-the-art data science methods, and immersion in collaborative project work. We find that hack weeks are successful at cultivating collaboration and facilitating the exchange of knowledge. Participants self-report that these events help them in both their day-to-day research as well as their careers. Based on our results, we conclude that hack weeks present an effective, easy-to-implement, fairly low-cost tool to positively impact data analysis literacy in academic disciplines, foster collaboration, and cultivate best practices.},
